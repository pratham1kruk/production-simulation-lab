Edit `.env` and add your API keys:
```env
RAWG_API_KEY=your_rawg_api_key_here
GIANTBOMB_API_KEY=your_giantbomb_api_key_here
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=5000
```

**Run:**
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

| `/lore/{game_slug}` | GET | Get game lore, description, storyline, themes |
| `/franchise/{franchise_name}/timeline` | GET | Get all franchise entries in chronological order |
| `/studio/{studio_name}/games` | GET | Get all games from a developer in release order |
| `/series/{game_name}/chain` | GET | Get predecessor → successor chain for a game series |

**Example Requests:**
```bash
# Search for a game
curl "http://localhost:5000/search?name=The+Witcher+3"

# Get game lore
curl "http://localhost:5000/lore/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt"

# Get franchise timeline
curl "http://localhost:5000/franchise/Assassin%27s%20Creed/timeline"

# Get studio history
curl "http://localhost:5000/studio/Naughty%20Dog/games"

# Get series chain
curl "http://localhost:5000/series/Assassin%27s%20Creed/chain"
```

**Architecture:**
```
Client Request
    ↓
FastAPI Router (main.py)
    ↓
Game Aggregator Service (aggregator.py)
    ↓
    ├→ RAWG Service (rawg.py)
    │   └→ RAWG API
    │
    └→ GiantBomb Service (giantbomb.py)
        └→ GiantBomb API
    ↓
Unified Response (models.py)
    ↓
Client
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- If API keys are invalid: Check .env file and verify keys at respective API websites
- If port 5000 is in use: Change PORT in .env and uvicorn command
- For CORS issues: The API allows all origins by default; modify main.py if needed
